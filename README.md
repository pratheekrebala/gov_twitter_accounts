# gov_twitter_accounts
Assorted collection of twitter accounts belonging to government officials/agencies/advisors for various data mining shenanigans.

Each text file contains 1 account per line. The metadata.json file for a description of each text file, the provenance of the data and some other useful metrics. There maybe duplicates across various files if a given account belongs to multiple categories (e.g. Political Campaigns & U.S. Senate)
